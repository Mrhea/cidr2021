# Code Prototypes for New Directions in Cloud Programming
This repo contains implementations of the code for the paper [New Directions in Cloud Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01159), CIDR 2021.

Currently, Bloom implementations are available. The "**P**rogram semantics" facet of the Hydrologic language is akin to Bloom in linking logic programming and lattics in a transducer model, so Bloom is a useful proof-of-concept---particularly to illustrate the lifting in the Appendix of the paper.
